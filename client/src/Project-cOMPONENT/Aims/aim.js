The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

                            <p>Transformed people transforming communities to transform the world.<br/>Our philosophy of ministry is all about sending transformed people into the communities of the world so they can be instruments in the hands of God to bring about transformation.
                            God has always used His “called out” ones to transform the world. He first transforms their lives and then calls them out to go into a lost world to transform others. In Joel 2:28, He promised to pour out His Spirit unto us, and, as a result, our young men and women will see visions and our old men and women will dream dreams.
                            God has given us a dream! This dream is to double the impact of World Gospel Mission in the next five years. Our impact is measured in the transformation of lives. In order to be true to our Vision Statement, this will mean that we will need to place more transformed people in communities around our globe. Doubling our impact will mean that we will need to double the number of missionaries.</p>
